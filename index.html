                the wall began over 2,000 years ago during the Qin Dynasty. The wall was built and rebuilt by several
                dynasties, with the majority of the existing wall constructed during the Ming Dynasty.</p>

                of various materials such as bricks, stones, wood, and tamped earth. Watchtowers, troop barracks, and
                garrison stations were built along the wall to enhance its defensive capabilities.</p>
